This project is developed for people who are interested in geography. Users can challenge themselves with their knowledge of capitals and flags.

I will add more features to this project, such as a Room database to track users' correct answers permanently. Additionally, I will include more options, like easy and hard difficulty levels, as well as continent-based quizzes.
